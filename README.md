# [MetroidVania.GG](https://metroidvania.gg)

MetroidVania.GG or MV.GG for short is a information hub for everything related to the videogame sub-gerne "metroidvanias". The majority of these games are made by small studios or even just a single person. Therefore sometimes it's hard to find these games. 
The **main** goal of the website is to signalboost metroidvanias that have either released or are still in development.
